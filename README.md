###Project 00 -- Tic Tac Toe###

- There are three folders and two files are included in the tic_tac_toe project: css folder, images folder, js folder, index.html and README.md.

- There are two games: two players and play with computer. Two players is a game that simply clicks the cell one after another (X and then O) and check who wins; play with computer, there is only one user and the computer plays randomly. 

- line 15 in index.html, this line of code is included to be able to use effect() function in tic_tac_toe.js which is used in line 32. 


##--- Playing The Game ---##

- always assume the user is playing with "X"

- when we put the mouse over an image, it will change the background color and shake, this will help us make sure we are not selecting a wrong element.

- everytime when the user wins (when "X" wins), the fireworks start.

- "Clear Board" button is used to reset the board without resetting the number of wins and the opponent.

- "Reset" button is used to reset everything to it's default (basically just refreshing the page).
